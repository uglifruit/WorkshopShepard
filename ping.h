// ping.h - the alt-boot PING mode: an invisible barber's pole you strike.
//
// The pole keeps climbing, silently. A trigger voices a PING at whatever
// pitches the pole is currently at - and that ping then decays WITHOUT
// climbing, because it is a snapshot rather than a window onto the moving
// stack.
//
// So the illusion is still running the whole time, but you only ever hear
// where it happens to be at the moments you strike it. Trigger repeatedly and
// each ping comes from a different point on the pole, building a chord out of
// one silently-rising structure. Because the pole wraps every octave, the
// sequence of pitches you can strike is endless but bounded - the barber's
// pole becomes a scale you play rather than a drone you listen to.
//
// This replaced SPIRAL as the alt-boot. SPIRAL was a pitch-shifting delay,
// which is a fine effect but had nothing to do with the card's own idea and
// occupied a lot of RAM to say so.
//
// A VOICE is a frozen copy of the oscillator bank: the per-layer increments
// and window gains as they were at the trigger, plus an envelope. Nothing in a
// voice moves except its envelope, which is exactly what "does not climb once
// voiced" means.

// TWO WRONG APPROACHES, both worth recording because each looked right:
//
//   A SHIFT. `env -= env >> n` is the obvious one-pole and it does not work
//   here: the envelope is 15 bits, so `env >> 17` is ZERO for every value it
//   can hold - the decay never begins and the voice rings forever. Anything
//   above ~14 stalls outright.
//
//   A BESPOKE Q20 MULTIPLY. Splitting env at bit 12 made the high term
//   4095 * 1048497 = 4.29e9, twice int32's limit - it wrapped NEGATIVE, the
//   envelope collapsed on its first sample, and every ping was a click
//   regardless of the knob. Moving the split to 15 fixed that term and broke
//   the other one (lo * c reaching 3.4e10). There is no single split that
//   works: hi needs s < 11 and lo needs s > 13.
//
// So: MulQ15, which is already proven safe for |x| up to 20e6 against an
// envelope peaking at 16.8e6, with the envelope carried in Q24 so a
// coefficient just under 1.0 still has bits to bite on. Measured 11 ms to
// 1.7 s:
//
//     [0]  0.011 s   a click
//     [4]  0.040 s   a pluck
//     [8]  0.137 s   a short bell
