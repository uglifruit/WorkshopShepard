// octave.h - the octave-stack pitch shifter: the live-audio half of the card.
//
// One delay line, N read heads running at 2^i times the write rate. Every
// partial of the input is transposed into N octave-spaced copies, weighted by
// the same window as the oscillator bank - so a 220 Hz partial appears at 55,
// 110, 220, 440 Hz and each copy RISES and fades exactly as an oscillator
// layer does.
//
// This is the third attempt at the live path, and the first that applies the
// actual Shepard CONSTRUCTION to the input rather than an effect that passes
// over it. The two before it failed the same way:
//
//   FREQUENCY SHIFTER  moved every partial by the same hertz, breaking the
//                      harmonic series. The input came back unrecognisable,
//                      so the relationship between source and output was
//                      inaudible.
//   RISING COMB        filtered the input with sweeping bands. A given partial
//                      is only heard while a band centre passes it, so it came
//                      and went rather than participating in the illusion.
//
// Both treated the input as something to process. This one octave-stacks it,
// which is what the card DOES - the internal voice is octave-stacked sines,
// and this is octave-stacked you.
//
// Costs no extra RAM: SPIRAL's delay buffer is idle in normal boot and this is
// idle in alt-boot, so they share it.

// are still meaningfully separated at the highest ratio used.

// 4x holds the worst case at 8.8 Hz.
