"""
ping_check.py - verify the alt-boot mode (displayed as HIDDEN BARBER; called
PING throughout the code, because a struck decaying voice is what a ping is).

The pole climbs silently; a trigger voices a snapshot of it, and that snapshot
DECAYS WITHOUT CLIMBING. What has to be true:

  - a struck voice's pitch must not change afterwards (that is the whole idea);
  - two strikes at different moments must give different pitches;
  - the envelope must decay to silence and free its slot;
  - voice stealing must take the OLDEST, so the newest strikes are the ones
    sounding;
  - the attack must not click.
