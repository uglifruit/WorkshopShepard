"""
passthru_check.py - end-to-end output level through the REAL integer chain.

THIS IS THE AUTHORITY ON SCALING. Run it after any change to a shift, a gain,
or a normalisation.

It exists because of a specific failure on the sibling card. WorkshopSpectral
shipped a build that was 512x too loud and clipped constantly - and its own
overlap-add test PASSED, because that test MODELLED the transform's gain
instead of running it, encoding the same wrong assumption as the firmware. The
only test that can catch that class of bug is one that drives the actual
integer arithmetic from input to output and checks the number that comes out.

So nothing here is modelled. The oscillator bank, the window, the
normalisation and the output clipper are all run as the firmware runs them.

Run: python tools/passthru_check.py
