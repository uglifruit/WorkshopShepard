"""
shepard_check.py - verify the oscillator bank's tables and, above all, the
window's constant-sum property.

The single most important assertion here is check_window_sum. The Shepard
illusion depends on the octave-spaced layers sliding through a fixed envelope
whose contributions ALWAYS sum to the same total. If that sum ripples, the
output level pulses once per octave and the illusion collapses into an audible
cycle - which is the failure mode that reads as "it sounds like a sweep, not an
infinite glide".

It is a mathematical property of sin^2 at even spacing, not a tuning, so it
should hold to the limits of integer rounding. If this test ever fails, the
window or the layer spacing has been changed and the card is broken.
