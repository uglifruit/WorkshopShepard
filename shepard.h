// shepard.h - the octave-stack oscillator bank and its spectral envelope.
//
// A Shepard tone is a stack of sine components spaced exactly one octave
// apart, all sliding together through a FIXED spectral envelope. Each
// component fades in at the bottom of the envelope, rises through it, and
// fades out at the top. Because the stack is octave-spaced, the configuration
// after sliding one whole octave is IDENTICAL to where it started - so the
// slide can be looped forever and the ear never catches the seam.
//
// Two quantities here are both called "phase" and must not be confused:
//
//   master_q32   a PITCH position. One octave = 2^32. Advances at the glide
//                rate, a few octaves per second at most. Its wrap IS the
//                illusion.
//   osc_q32[i]   an AUDIO phase. One cycle = 2^32. Advances at that layer's
//                frequency, up to ~28 kHz.
//
// Conflating them is the fastest way to break this card.
//
// Everything is fixed point. See fixed.h for why that is not negotiable.

// 3 is the floor because two layers do not read as a continuous stack - you

//
// 11 is the ceiling because of NYQUIST, and the reason is worth recording
// since 12 looks like the natural number and was the original choice.
//
// Each layer added shifts the perceived pitch of the stack up by half a
// window slot, which at octave spacing is exactly +600 cents. That is even
// from N=3 to N=11 - measured 0.0 cents of deviation.
//
// At N=12 the top layer sits at 13.75 * 2^11 = 28160 Hz, above the 24 kHz
// Nyquist limit. It still carries window gain (0.067) and still counts in the
// constant-sum, but contributes NOTHING audible - so the audible centre lands
// 68 cents short of where the pattern leads the ear to expect. Heard on
// hardware as the pitch dropping about a semitone when the last layer is
// added, and very obvious when frozen.
//
// Capping at 11 keeps the top layer at 14080 Hz, comfortably audible, so
// every layer contributes and the pattern stays even all the way up.

//
// Reuses the FIRST HALF of sin_lut, because sin(pi*u) == sin(2*pi*(u/2)).
// No second table.
//
// Why this window and not another - the property that makes the card work:
//
//   sum over layers of hann((master_frac + i)/N)  ==  N/2   EXACTLY,
//
// for every layer count and every master phase, with ZERO ripple. That is the
// same constant-overlap-add property that makes a Hann window at 50% overlap
// work, and it is why the output level does not pulse as layers cycle through
// the envelope. It is a mathematical guarantee, not a tuning - do not
// "improve" this window. tools/shepard_check.py asserts it.
//
// It also handles both ends of the stack for free: hann(0) == hann(1) == 0
// exactly, so a layer entering at the bottom and one leaving at Nyquist are
// both silent. The octave wrap is a no-op in the audio - there is nothing to
// crossfade and nothing to click.
// THE LOOKUP MUST INTERPOLATE. This is not a refinement - a truncated read
// breaks the constant-sum property above, and it does so ASYMMETRICALLY:
//
//     truncated:     N even -> 0.006% ripple,  N odd -> up to 0.48%
//     interpolated:  every N -> 0.012%, at the integer rounding floor
//
// At even layer counts the layer positions land on exact table entries and the
// truncation error cancels between them; at odd counts they fall between
// entries and it does not. So a truncated version tests clean at N=4, 6, 8 and
// pulses audibly at N=3, 5, 7 - which reads as "the illusion only works at
// some densities" and is very hard to attribute to the window.
//
// Caught by tools/shepard_check.py::check_window_sum, which is exactly the
// kind of bug that test exists to find. Interpolating costs ~6 cycles, at
// control rate, once per layer.
