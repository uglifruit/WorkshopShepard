// SHEPARD - a Shepard-Risset infinite-glissando card for the Music Thing
// Modular Workshop System Computer.
//
// A Shepard tone is octave-spaced components sliding together through a fixed
// spectral envelope. Each fades in at the bottom, rises, and fades out at the
// top; because the stack is octave-spaced, one full slide returns it to
// exactly where it started, so the glide can loop forever without a seam.
//
// Structure:
//   shepard.cpp   tables, window, scale quantisation  (tools/shepard_check.py,
//                                                      tools/quant_check.py)
//   comb.h        rising comb filter for live audio    (tools/comb_check.py)
//   ping.h        alt-boot: strike the invisible pole  (tools/ping_check.py)
//   main.cpp      panel, CV, LEDs, and the audio ISR
//
// CORE SPLIT - deliberately NOT WorkshopSpectral's arrangement.
//
// That card puts its DSP on core 1 because an FFT frame costs ~0.5 ms, 24x the
// per-sample budget: it CANNOT run inline, and the ring buffer is the price of
// admission. An additive oscillator bank has no frame structure at all - every
// sample costs the same, there is nothing to batch and no deadline to miss.
//
// So everything runs in the audio ISR, and the expensive control-rate work
// (one pow2 lookup, the window weights, quantisation) runs inline every 32nd
// sample. That removes the cross-core protocol entirely, along with the ring
// races and stale-slot bugs that dominate the sibling card's debugging notes.
// It also degrades honestly: if this were ever too slow the ISR would overrun
// visibly, where a block renderer turns the same fault into an intermittent
// underrun that is miserable to reproduce.
//
// Core 1 stays free. CV Out 2 reports the real measured load - if that ever
// reads high, the control block is what moves across.
