// The RP2040's Cortex-M0+ has no FPU. A float multiply is soft-emulated at
// ~360 ns against a 20.8 us per-SAMPLE budget, so a single float in the audio
// path is not a slow choice - it is a broken one. Everything here exists to
// keep the DSP in integers.
//
// It also has no 64-bit multiply. `(int64_t)a * b >> 15` compiles to a call to
// __aeabi_lmul plus sign extension, 64-bit adds with carry and register
// spills. WorkshopSpectral measured that at over twice its frame budget before
// MulQ15 replaced it. So: no int64 in the hot path, ever.
//
// Verify after any refactor - the binary should contain no lmul at all:
//     arm-none-eabi-nm build/shepard.elf | grep aeabi_lmul     # want nothing
//
// Unlike WorkshopSpectral, this card does NOT set PICO_INT64_OPS_IN_RAM. That
// flag exists there because FFT butterflies genuinely need 64-bit products.
// Here an __aeabi_lmul in the binary means a bug to find, not a flag to add.
